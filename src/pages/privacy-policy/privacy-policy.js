              Personal Information with that partner.
            </p>

              Information, depending on each of their specific roles and
              purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services, and may only
              use it for such purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              d. Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies. We may share Personal
              Information internally within our family of companies, for the
              purposes described in this Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              e. Business Transfers. Should Honeydu or any of its affiliates
              undergo any change in control, including by means of merger,
              acquisition, or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your
              Personal Information may be shared with the parties involved in
              such event. If we believe that such change in control might
              materially affect your Personal Information then stored with us,
              we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via
              e-mail or prominent notice on our Services.

              requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and
              regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we have a good
              faith belief that we are legally compelled to do so, or that
              disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to
              investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected
              illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing.
